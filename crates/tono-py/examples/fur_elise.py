"""fur_elise — Beethoven's Bagatelle No. 25 in A minor, WoO 59 ("Für Elise",
1810): the famous opening section, played on the sampled grand. The
composition is public domain; the note data follows the Breitkopf & Härtel
1888 edition (via the Mutopia Project, also public domain).

Where golden_hour shows the producer side of the typed API, this one shows
the classical side: a real 3/8 meter map with an eighth-note pickup, phrase
patterns arranged on true bar boundaries, a ritardando on the tempo map, and
per-note dynamics (the edition is marked pp — the left hand whispers).

Run with an installed tono wheel (or `maturin develop` in crates/tono-py):

    python3 examples/fur_elise.py

It compiles the song, renders the mix, and writes `fur_elise.wav` (16-bit
stereo) into the current directory — that's the track to listen to.
